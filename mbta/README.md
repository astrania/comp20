# README - MBTA part 1

1. All the parts have been implemented successfully:
   Render a red polyline connecting all the redline stations,
   and show the stations on the map with the MBTA icon. 
   When first open the map, the map is centered at South Station.

2. Discuss with or colloborate with no one in class.

3. Spent approximately 4 hours. Spent most of the time understanding
   the examples on google map's developers guide: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple, as well 
   as fixing compliling errors.
